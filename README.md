# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis
	The purpose of the analysis was to quantify and qualify the performance of schools based on various metrics and categorizations.
	In addition, this analysis was preformed to gain a more accurate picture of the performance of these schools after suspisious test scores were removed.
	There are boradly speaking 7 analysis I've made in this file
	-The percent of students passing reading, math, and overall (meaning they passed both) per school.
	-The top 5 schools in terms of overall passing rate
	-The botom 5 schools in terms of overall passing rate
	-The average scores for math and reading per grade for each school
	-The scores by spending per student
	-School size and its relationship toward score
	-Score averages by the type of school (district or charter)

### Other metrics affected by the audit
	-After the Audit Thomas High Schools 9th grade math and reading scores went from 83.6 and 83.7 respectively to NaN. 
	

	- Thomas High School is in the 630-644 range of spending so that was the only range affected.
	We saw a small drop in average overall passing rate of 0.08% in that spending range
	
	(spending before)
	(spending after)

	- The difference between the scores by school type was small enough that it becomes negligible when you format to one decimal place.
	However, since Thomas High School was a charter school, we do see a 0.04% drop in overall passing when looking at the unformated data frame.

	- The difference in scores by size is small enought to the point that it becomes nigligible when you format to one deciaml place.  
	However, since Thomas High School was a middle sized school (1000-2000 students), we do see a 0.07% drop in overall passing when looking at the unformated data frame.
## Summary

	-We saw Thomas High School's preformance metrics decrease slightly
